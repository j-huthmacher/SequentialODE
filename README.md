# SequentialODE

This machine learning model, called "SequentialODE", is an implementation of the idea of using Neural Ordinary Differential Equations to process and forecast time series.

The implementation based on the approach presented in the paper [Neural Ordinary Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07366).

**Important: This repo is in progress, i.e. some explanations or an instruction for the usage is missing.**

## Usage
Feel free to try the implementation by using the provided notebook ([sequential-ode-get-started.ipynb](./notebooks/sequential-ode-get-started.ipynb)).
